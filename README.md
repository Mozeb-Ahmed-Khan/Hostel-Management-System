# Hostel Management System

## Project Overview

The Hostel Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to efficiently manage all aspects of residential accommodation at a college or university. This project involves both web-based application development and Oracle database management to handle various functionalities such as student registration, room allocation, meal plans, facility management, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Building Information**: Manages details about hostel buildings, including name, type (e.g., Girls, Boys, Staff), location, number of floors, and rooms.
- **Room Information**: Records details about room strength, assets, and facilities.
- **Student Information**: Manages student details, room allocation, availability, and room shifting.
- **Attendance Management**: Tracks student check-in and check-out times and maintains attendance logs.
- **Fee Management**: Handles mess bill collection, hostel bills master, maintenance charges, repairs, and daily expenses.
- **Feedback Collection**: Gathers regular feedback on rooms, food, and other amenities.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: Sends fee reminders to registered students.
- **Additional Records**: Maintains records for the gym and visitor management.

### Skills Learned:
- **Project Management**: Coordinated and managed various aspects of the project development.
- **Database Design and Management**: Designed and managed the Oracle database to support the application.
- **Web Application Development**: Developed a web-based application for managing hostel operations.
- **User Interface Design**: Created an intuitive and user-friendly interface for end-users.
- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collected and analyzed data for effective hostel management.
- **Technical Writing**: Documented the system design, features, and functionalities comprehensively.

### Technologies Used:
- **Oracle Database**: For backend data storage and management.
- **Web-based Technologies**: For developing the application interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
- **Server-Side Scripting**: For handling business logic and database interactions (e.g., PHP, Java, etc.).

### Project Statement

The Hostel Management System is designed to provide a full-featured accommodation system to efficiently manage residential facilities. It reduces staff workload and paperwork by maintaining up-to-date records of students, their meal and lodging preferences, room transfers, and other facilities.
